# Demo Git Repository

This is the first file in this repo

## Additional text
The Git configuration file contains a number of variables that affect the Git commands' behavior. The files .git/config and optionally config.worktree (see the "CONFIGURATION FILE" section of git-worktree(1)) in each repository are used to store the configuration for that repository, and $HOME/.gitconfig is used to store a per-user configuration as fallback values for the .git/config file. The file /etc/gitconfig can be used to store a system-wide default configuration.
